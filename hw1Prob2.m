% the objective function to minimize
f = [2300, 600]

% our constaint matrix
Aeq = [1 1]

% our solution b vector
beq = [10]

% unclear fully as to what these are, so leaving empty for now
A = [
    1, -2;
    -2, 1;
    2300, 600
    ]
b = [0; 0; 10000] 

% our bounds, and in this case, we are only sending through 1 unit, so the
% upperbound is just a one vector, the lower is zeros.
lb = zeros(2, 1)
ub = ones (2, 1) .* 10

% and, well, let her rip?
sol = linprog(f, A, b, Aeq, beq, lb, ub)
